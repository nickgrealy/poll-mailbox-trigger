Feature: Runtime - Start Job

  Background: The tests are setup
    Given the plugin is initialised
    Given a mailbox with domain mail.com and username rick
    And the script
    """
    storeName=imap
    mail.imap.connectiontimeout=1000
    """
    When I set the configuration to
      | Host     | Username | Password |
      | mail.com | rick     | chickens |

  # happy path


  Scenario: I want the Job's description to tell me who started the job,
  So that I can have accountability
    Given the emails

    When the Plugin's polling is triggered
    Then a Jenkins job is scheduled with quietPeriod 0 and cause '[PollMailboxTrigger] Job was triggered by email sent from fred@email.com (<a href="triggerCauseAction">log</a>)'


  Scenario: I the job's logging to give me useful information,
  So that I know exactly what happened
